	<div id='text'>
		<p>A body pressed against flatness. A body divided in sections, into different sensations of this surface. The hard bed, like a green brick with the fabric pulled flat and taught, pushing against a chest with a t shirt in between. Then, no more t shirt. Bare skin, bare ass, bare legs. A body, limp because it has a surface to hold it, but tense because the surface presses back. Weighted shoulders against a pillow, leaving an arm slack against the body, facing both forward and backward, elbow locked, fingers extended upward. A locked elbow, but a bent knee, a neck turned entirely to the left. A whole body against this flatness. Immobile, in a blue room.
		</p>
		<p>The window shutters are open, light comes into the room and immediately outside there are leaves and a blue sky that suggest there should be a breeze, or would be a breeze. It would be nice if there was a breeze. A breeze on a bare ass in a perfectly still room. But there is none. A single eye in a flushed face witnessing the stillness, as the entire front of the body feels the flatness, mediated by white fabric. Pink with warmth in a cool flat room, pooling, becoming the temperature of the room, as it remains still.
		</p>
		<p>And then toes on nothing, hanging over the sharp edge of the bed. Toes in tube socks pressed against nothing, feeling none of the solidity of the objects in the room. Lit by the bright, angled white light from the window.
