				<p class="textpreview">It’s like this and it’s like that, let me tell you, because this and that would take a novel to explain, and it’s not that I don’t like novels, it’s only that I don’t have so much time, not that I’m dying either, only that I like to walk in cemeteries, sometimes I like to walk in cemeteries, sometimes I like to sleep in cemeteries, but not to live in cemeteries, it’s not possible to live in a cemetery, they aren’t built for living in, and being dead takes a lot more time than living so we call it heaven, but that doesn’t change the fact that god was so bored he had to come to earth just to kill himself. </p>

				<p class="textpreview">A body pressed against flatness. A body divided in sections, into different sensations of this surface. The hard bed, like a green brick with the fabric pulled flat and taught, pushing against a chest with a t shirt in between. Then, no more t shirt. Bare skin, bare ass, bare legs.  A body, limp because it has a surface to hold it, but tense because the surface presses back. Weighted shoulders against a pillow, leaving an arm slack against the body, facing both forward and backward, elbow locked, fingers extended upward. </p>

				(After all I shouldn’t complain New York has been good to me.)<br><br>
				I can’t write you a letter<br>
				I wanted to... but I torn them up.
