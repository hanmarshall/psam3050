		<p class="main"><span>It’s like this and it’s like that, </span><span>let me tell you, </span><span>because this and that would take a novel to explain, </span><span>and it’s not that I don’t like novels, </span><span>it’s only that I don’t have so much time, </span><span>not that I’m dying either, </span><span>only that I like to walk in cemeteries, </span><span>sometimes I like to walk in cemeteries, </span><span>sometimes I like to sleep in cemeteries, </span><span>but not to live in cemeteries, </span><span>it’s not possible to live in a cemetery, </span><span>they aren’t built for living in, </span><span>and being dead takes a lot more time than living so we call it heaven, </span><span>but that doesn’t change the fact that god was so bored he had to come to earth just to kill himself. </span><span class="start">A garden is a cemetery for love letters. </span><span>How sad after all to walk by trees and over stone bridges on a bright and soft and cool spring day, </span><span>the sadness that beauty gives us when it reminds us of another beauty. </span><span>And then the fallen petals, </span><span>still pink on the path, </span><span>still pink, </span><span>as if just bloomed, </span><span>and the urge to steal them, </span><span>sweet trash, </span><span>to steal them all. </span><span>I don’t have much time because I am so tired these days, </span><span>so tired of walking, </span><span>and I walk because an empty room is heaven, </span><span>and I’m trying to spend as little time in heaven as possible, </span><span>so I have been walking, </span><span>but I can’t escape, </span><span>because what happens when you stop walking is that you return to heaven, </span><span>and the bed is so comfortable, </span><span>the fridge is full of milk, </span><span>but no one is talking, </span><span>so you're breathing, </span><span>breathing, </span><span>sweet air, </span><span>and nothing happens. </span><span>A lot happens in my head when nothing happens, </span><span>and what happens in my head is what I wish was not happening, </span><span>but it is anyway, </span><span>and the birds don’t help, </span><span>I watch the birds, </span><span>I watch the birds in the sunset and feel nothing. </span><span>I don’t know how to feel about birds, </span><span>so I watch the birds, </span><span>but it is more beautiful when I read about someone watching birds, </span><span>and that someone tells me how to love the birds. </span><span>I like words, </span><span>only words, </span><span>so you might ask why I don’t write a novel, </span><span>but I wrote a novel once, </span><span>and the novel is in a drawer, </span><span>because if I take it out of the drawer, </span><span>well, </span><span>that would be too many words, </span><span>it is dangerous to say so much, </span><span>I discovered the name of god, </span><span>but that name is too much, </span><span>it erases all your other words, </span><span>when you speak the name of god that is your final word, </span><span>and so I hid my novel in a drawer. </span><span>I have spent, </span><span>in my life, </span><span>many days, </span><span>many hours, </span><span>in the dark, </span><span>in gardens bereft of lanterns, </span><span>but mostly in one garden, </span><span>I am the one who haunts the garden, </span><span>and by <em>I</em> perhaps I mean what we, </span><span>in concession, </span><span>it always makes me bashful, </span><span>what we call the soul. </span><span>I have gone to place candles there, </span><span>in the branches, </span><span>among leaves, </span><span>in the <em>soul</em>, </span><span>which is to me, </span><span>because of my particular affections, </span><span>imagined as a garden. </span><span>But really it is nothing, </span><span>nothing, </span><span>there is no word for it. </span><span>Nonetheless, </span><span>I have attempted, </span><span>with blind hands, </span><span>because hands are always blind, </span><span>just as eyes are deaf, </span><span>I have attempted to know what waits, </span><span>what swarms there in the dark, </span><span>in the garden, </span><span>my mosquitoes, </span><span>or my butterflies, </span><span>it’s all the same. </span><span>Listen, </span><span>about the book, </span><span>I finished it, </span><span>as I said, </span><span>and locked it in a drawer, </span><span>but the idea of my book, </span><span>which began before the beginning, </span><span>and ends long after the end, </span><span>I can’t lock the idea of my book in a drawer, </span><span>I carry it with me, </span><span>I bear it on my shoulders, </span><span>but I <em>can’t bear it</em>, </span><span>and nonetheless it remains on my shoulders, </span><span>because inside my soul is a pebble, </span><span>somewhere in my soul I discovered a pebble, </span><span>and the only way to kill yourself, </span><span>the only way you can decide to kill yourself, </span><span>is by vomiting up that pebble, </span><span>otherwise you can’t do it, </span><span>you can only <em>suffer</em>, </span><span>or endure what is called a <em>passion</em>, </span><span>these two words, </span><span>historically, </span><span>are synonyms, </span><span>though unless we attend mass, </span><span>we tend to forget, </span><span>but I don’t forget, </span><span>not because I attend mass, </span><span>but because there is an angel in my closet who whispers from my sock drawer, </span><span>sometimes saying sweet words, </span><span>and sometimes cruel words, </span><span>but who shackles my hand to the typewriter. </span><span>When I write to you it is with shackled hands, </span><span>I don’t mind, </span><span>I don’t mind at all, </span><span>I like words, </span><span>after all, </span><span>it’s only that I’m tired of saying I like this or that, </span><span>because then I become a symbol for this or that, </span><span>and then I am disgusted by this or that, </span><span>revulsed by this or that, </span><span>when people assume I like anything associated with this or that, </span><span>for example, </span><span>when I wrote my book, </span><span>which was <em>a book about flowers</em>, </span><span>or so I said, </span><span>I always said, </span><span><em>a book about flowers</em>, </span><span>when I wrote that book, </span><span>everyone talked to me about flowers, </span><span>and everyone sent me gifts, </span><span>when they sent me gifts, </span><span>everyone sent me gifts of flowers, </span><span>or wallpaper printed with flowers, </span><span>or blouses printed with flowers, </span><span>or perfumes, </span><span>or potpourri, </span><span>until I hated flowers. </span><span>So I am less inclined now to talk about flowers, </span><span>to tell anyone I like flowers, </span><span>although I liked flowers more than anything else, </span><span>I liked to talk about flowers more than anything else, </span><span>but flowers have been ruined by too many words. </span><span>Now I only say I like this or that, </span><span>it’s like this or that, </span><span>but I don't say what this is, </span><span>or what that is, </span><span>but you can’t write a novel about <em>this</em> or <em>that</em>, </span><span>or if you can it would be an impossible novel, </span><span>so I won’t write a novel, </span><span>I will tell you a story, </span><span>a brief story, </span><span>and then I will take a walk.</span>
